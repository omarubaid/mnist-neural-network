# MNIST Digit Classification with Keras
MNIST neural network implementation, training, and evaluation.

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The trained model is saved and later used to make predictions on user-provided images.

## Project Structure

- `mnist_cnn_with_dropout.py`: Contains the code to train the CNN on the MNIST dataset and save the model as 'mnist_model.h5'.
- `loaded_mnist_model_digit_predictor.py`: Loads the trained model and makes predictions on user-provided images.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install keras matplotlib numpy pillow
```

## Usage
### Training the Model

    Run mnist_cnn_with_dropout.py to train the CNN on the MNIST dataset and the graph curves for loss and accuracy are plotted.
    The trained model will be saved as 'mnist_model5.h5'.

### Making Predictions

    Provide your handwritten digit image in the image_path variable in loaded_mnist_model_digit_predictor.py.
    Run predict_digit.py to load the trained model and make predictions on the provided image.

## File Descriptions

## Project Notes

While the project successfully demonstrates handwritten digit recognition, it's important to note potential areas for improvement:

### Model Predictions

The model's predictions are functional but may not be optimal in all cases. If you encounter instances of incorrect predictions, consider the following:

1. **Image Pre-processing:** Ensure input images conform to the specified dimensions (28x28 pixels) and are in grayscale. Experiment with different pre-processing techniques, including color inversion, for potential improvements.

    Example pre-processing steps:

    ```python
    # Your image pre-processing code here
    ```

2. **Model Fine-tuning:** Explore opportunities for fine-tuning the model architecture, hyperparameters, or consider incorporating additional diverse data for improved generalization.

3. **Acknowledgment:** Recognizing these considerations, the project serves as a foundation for ongoing learning and optimization.

This documentation aims to provide transparency and encourages further exploration and refinement of the model for enhanced performance.
