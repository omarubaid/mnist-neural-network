# MNIST Digit Classification with Keras
MNIST neural network implementation, training, and evaluation.



## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple neural network implementation using the Keras library for the MNIST digit classification task. The model is trained to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using the popular MNIST dataset.


## Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Keras
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install keras matplotlib
